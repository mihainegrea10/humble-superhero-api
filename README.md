 * Collaboration Notes:
 * If working with a teammate, I would suggest pair programming for initial setup,
 * followed by peer reviews to refine code quality. We could also use GitHub issues
 * to track improvements and ensure alignment.
 *
 * If I had more time:
 * - Implement database persistence (e.g., PostgreSQL or MongoDB).
 * - Add authentication and role-based access control.
 * - Create unit tests and API documentation.
 * - Improve error handling with proper status codes and messages.
